In hindsight, I really should have expected that Jenkins would have attracted a
journalist's attention.

Within hours, our conversation was the big talking point on a major interstellar
newsfeed complete with an alarmist headline. Clips from it were discussed on
political discussion broadcasts, most of them chosen to show the worst possible
take on what Jenkins had been saying.

Three diurnals later, the council convened a special meeting. I was part of the
security force that flew Jenkins to Capitol Station to be interviewed by a
special committee. I wasn't permitted to witness the interview, but every being
that entered that chamber exited displaying the signs of worry and stress.

Events moved quickly after that. A civilian fleet set out to make contact with
Earth in the hopes of peacefully talking them down from this “religion”
nonsense. It was met at the edge of their solar system by a vigilante fleet that
had apparently been preparing to divert a comet in-system to hit Earth. The navy
arrived to break up the resulting fight, but only after horrible casualties to
both sides.

The incident prompted the council to do two things: first they passed an
amendment to the Treaty that allowed for a species to be declared sentient if it
had developed calculus, rather than interplanetary FTL, though the Contact
Prohibition would remain in effect until the species went interplanetary.

The second thing it prompted was the declaration of a surveillance and research
mission to Earth. I requested, and was granted, a transfer and promotion to head
of security on the research station. The station displaced into the Earth system
five eight-diurnals after the mission was announced, using the bulk of a large
ringed gas world known as “Saturn” to mask the neutrino burst of its arrival.
Sheathed in a stealth field that bent all electromagnetic radiation around
itself, and using centripetal spin rather than generated gravity, it was
designed to go completely undetected. The last thing the station did before
activating this field was to spit two probes that embedded themselves in Earth's
lone, large moon so as to snoop on the human race's communications networks and
forward the information to us on the observatory.

We would have begun sooner, if the station had not been fitted with a specialist
living module for Jenkins and two other human abductees who had requested a
place on the mission. Mounted on a trio of boom arms well out from the main body
of the station, it provided the higher gravity their species was used to, as
well as a warmer, denser, more humid atmosphere. I visited it only once - aside
from being a third heavier than usual, I swiftly felt the heat and humidity
making me unwell and returned to the core of the station, which was tuned to the
interstellar norm I was used to.

The other humans were quite dissimilar to Jenkins. Charlotte was from the same
landmass and political entity as he was, but was older than him and had
apparently joined the mission so as to preach the “truth” of the very religion
we were there to study. Most of the crew found it impossible to believe that she
was not insane, but Jenkins assured me that her beliefs were considered
perfectly normal. He seemed embarrassed by the fact.

The other, a male called Jung, pointed out a peninsula on the prograde end of
the largest land mass when asked where his home was. He refused to be drawn on
the subject of religion, instead preferring to compensate for the gaps in
Jenkins' and Charlotte's knowledge regarding that region of their planet.

We spent a lot of time monitoring the political situation at first. Jenkins and
Charlotte got into a vicious argument about a protracted conflict in a dry, hot
part of the world that had apparently only just started when they were abducted.
Jenkins later explained to me that Charlotte had praised what she saw as a war
between her own religion against another, rival one.

“It's crazy”. He complained to me, in private. “They're both products of the
same religious root anyway!”

I began to suspect, however, that Jenkins had not been entirely fair about his
own species. My job was trivially easy, so I spent much of my time browsing the
content of their worldwide data network. Whenever Jenkins was with me, I noticed
that he had a habit of focusing on the worst aspects. It was when I started to
explore without his guiding hand that I started to find the positives.

I had never paid much attention to poetry, art and fiction. Those things exist
in all species, but the alien concepts these things expressed, and the way in
which they expressed them, broke through that barrier for me.

Some, I couldn't stand---monotonous, pulsing music that seemed to delight in
going nowhere, broadcasts which appeared to take a morbid fascination in the
opinions of beings that, among my own species, would have been locked up for
their own safety and medicated. Other specimens of their art were interesting,
thought-provoking. A few inspired quite intense emotions in me. I enjoyed
watching their movies, and Jenkins and I spent nearly a full diurnal watching
first a series of enjoyable fantasies called “Star Wars”, then a trilogy called
“The Lord of the Rings” which I then discovered had originally been a book and
read.

Our musical tastes were different---he introduced me to his favourite genres,
which I found shallow and noisy, he disliked the ones that most inspired me. I
had trouble understanding how somebody could hear the music written by
Khachaturian, Tchaikovsky, Bach and Rutter and consider them “dull”, but other
members of the crew reported that they preferred Jenkins' taste in music.
Whatever else it was, Earth was a rich source of artistic exports.

It was also a fountain of though-provoking philosophy, novel ideas and unique
pastimes. Human words started to slip into the languages of the station's crew,
filling gaps in our philosophical vocabulary. Once every eight-diurnals, five of
the crew could be found gathered around a table in the mess hall, rolling number
polyhedra and apparently immersed in fantastical battles against impossible
creatures that could breath fire, or turn a warrior to stone by meeting its
gaze.

Another group borrowed the idea of “poetry reading” and took it in turns to
stand up and read their compositions aloud---an exercise doomed to
ridiculousness by the fact no two of them spoke the same language, but they took
to it with enthusiasm.

I had to gently ask the scientists to stop gambling on the outcome of human
contests of physical skill and endurance, or to at least exercise some
moderation.

As part of my job, I was required to pass information of potential military
significance back to the Council. The concept of the “taser” was among the very
first. The idea of the “suicide bomber” was alarming, and caused something of a
stir when it was presented to the committee for interstellar security, who
called an emergency session to think up means by which such an insane tactic
could be countered. In the end, they wound up stealing the best ideas from
humanity itself.

It was only when I encountered the idea of the “tortured poet” that things
started to fall into place. Up until that point, I had been struggling to
reconcile the artistic power of these beings, and the nobility of their heroic
visions of themselves, with the relentless delusion and grinding unpleasantness
enacted in its name that played out before me. Now I began to see the shape of
it.

The “Demons”---a loan-word that had filled a conceptual gap we had never been
aware of---that tormented humanity were what inspired it. Surrounded on all
sides by an ecosystem saturated with toxic microfauna and parasitic
nanoorganisms, by vicious predators, hardy prey and an explosively unstable
tectonic world, they sacrificed their own peace of mind on the altar of
evolution.

They are...not crazy. They are something far more than that. They are tortured
geniuses. When they finally get off their world in a meaningful way, when they
finally become eligible for contact and for introduction into the interstellar
community, we will need to handle them with utmost care.

They are physically powerful. They are strong enough to wield firearms that are
powerful enough to overwhelm even the most powerful personal shielding, while
our own weaponry will hardly slow them down. The chemical weapons they use as
less-lethal alternatives would slaughter us. The water cannons they use to
suppress riots would pulverize our bones. They are not only willing to die in
the name of a fiction, they will do so gladly and eagerly. They are mentally
overwhelming---their ideas are powerful, their inventiveness puts us to shame,
their philosophy explores avenues of thought that simply never occurred to us.

But the most important part is that they must never, ever learn how much
superior they are to us in so many ways. I think the idea would break them.

You see, Earth is a death world. To survive, they had to evolve not just
intelligence, but the ability to apply it like a weapon. They didn't evolve to
merely overcome adversity---they evolved to thrive on it. They *need* to have
something to aspire to, something they think is bigger than they are. They need
something to fight. Without a challenge, I think they very swiftly get
depressed.

Kevin Jenkins did. I didn't see it at the time, but I think that getting into
space and finding that he could rip the limbs off its worst terrors really upset
him. He never told me why he asked to have his social implant removed, and why
he went back to Earth. But I can guess.

He did it because there are more challenges down there among his own kind than
he would ever find up here, among us.
