I found the human Kevin Jenkins in conversation with one of the station's senior
lawyers on the public promenade deck. I had been retired from the customs and
immigration desk on the docking ring while my injuries were repaired, and
instead had spent much of the last three groups of eight standard diurnals
dealing with the paperwork and investigative work that had followed the Hunter
attack. I had seen him only twice since---once when I saw him on the news feed
as galactic media briefly turned their attention to our station and its unusual
story, and the second time was when I took his statement for the official
incident report.

On the news, his eye had still been swollen and ugly, much of his flesh had
darkened and bruised from minor haemorrhaging, and he had been wincing with pain
every time he drew breath. When I interviewed him, the swelling had gone down
and the pain in his breath had gone away. Now, twenty diurnals after the attack,
there was just some greenish discolouration to show that he had ever been
injured.

My arm, meanwhile, had needed amputating, and I was still adjusting to the
plastic and carbon fibre prosthetic that had replaced it. He raised a forelimb
and waggled his paw---hand---at me as I approached, and our social cybernetics
agreed that this was a gesture of greeting.

"Kirk!" he exclaimed. He was completely unable to pronounce my name, so had
taken to approximating the first syllable, with my permission. He was still yet
to explain why he had found it so amusing to call me that. A chair reconfigured
itself for my anatomy and I straddled it. Jenkins received no such luxury from
the chairs, but seemed comfortable enough anyway.

"I hope I am not interrupting, Lawyer Vedregnenug?" I asked.

"You are not, Officer A'ktnn," Vedreg replied. He and I were good acquaintances,
but his species are sticklers for observing some formalities upon greeting one
another. "Purveyor Jenkins and I were discussing his petition to have his
species reclassified as sentient."

"Purveyor Jenkins?" I asked.

"Back on Earth I owned a recreational establishment." the human said, sipping
his glass of water. I had noticed already that his water intake was surprisingly
high considering his size, and made a note to ask him about it.  

"I assumed you were military." I told him. He chuckled.  

"Nope."

"But you were fearless when those Hunters were shooting you!" I exclaimed. He
did that complicated joint-lift with his forelimbs again---a *'shrug.'*  

"How's your arm?" he asked, changing the subject.

"I am adapting to it. Thank you. So you think you may be able to have humans
reclassified?"

A wave of purple pigmentation rippled down Vedreg's flank---pessimism. "It would
require an amendment to the Galactic Treaty of Laws" he said "Which the council
is historically stubborn to tamper with. Amending the Treaty tends to lose
votes."

Jenkins issued a coarse sound through his nasal orifice---derision---but said
nothing. He rolled up the sleeves of fabric that covered his forelimbs until
they were bunched around the mid-joint. I noticed that a patch of skin on his
left arm had been artificially pigmented. It was a simple design---one long
line, crossed by a shorter one.

His skin went bumpy and raised his sparse body fur. His social implant reported
no emotional context for that, so I assumed it was an automatic response to some
environmental factor. Aliens can be surprisingly strange at the best of times,
but I was beginning to suspect that humans may be weirder than most. The medical
report from the team that provided care to Jenkins after the battle said that
his blood stream contained a powerful combat drug, though I was certain he
hadn't ingested, inhaled or injected any during the fight. There hadn't been
time.

Muscles shifted under his thin brown skin as he tapped his digits on the
tabletop in a simple one-two-three rhythm. In any other species the movement
would have looked obscenely organic.

"Fascinating biology." Vedred agreed with me, and I indicated embarrassment---
clearly I had been displaying my fascination openly enough for my social implant
to broadcast it. "How strong *are* you, Purveyor Jenkins?"

Jenkins shrugged "Strong enough to rip the leg off a Hunter and beat another
Hunter to death with it." he said. "I don't know how that translates."

"I meant by the standards of your own species." Vedreg clarified.

Jenkins thought about it. "Uh...I don't know. I try to stay in shape, but
between the low gravity and not getting enough food I've probably lost some
muscle...about or slightly below average for a male of my size?" he suggested.

Vedreg and I exchanged a glance that bypassed the social implants.  "There are
going to be a lot of nervous species out there when your kind develop quantum
communication" Vedreg opined.

"You have no idea." Jenkins muttered. The twin patches of fur above his eyes
creased inwards and downwards---my translator informed me that this emotion had
no equivalent in my species.

"Unarmed, you single-handedly defeated three of the most feared aliens in known
space, and you tell us you are neither a trained warrior nor a physically
exceptional specimen of your kind. The security footage records you being shot
seven times by heavy pulse gun fire and you have fully healed in less than
three-times-eight diurnals." I said. "Many officers have suggested to me that
you are a security threat, on the grounds that if you decided to go on a violent
rampage, there would be little that could stop you."

"You have those nervejam grenade things." he pointed out.

"Those are lethal." I replied.

"But they'd work. They gave me a splitting headache from across the room."

I filed this away as a rebuttal for the next officer to approach me on the
subject. At that distance, the nervejam grenades should not have affected him at
all. Heightened sensitivity? Then I realised I was treating this man who had
saved my life as if he was a threat that I needed to figure out how to kill and
suppressed a flash of shame.

"I'm surprised, actually." Jenkins confessed.

"What by?" Vedreg asked.

"By how easily they broke. I knew I was stronger and tougher than most sentient
life, but I had no idea the difference was that big. It's...intimidating. I feel
like Superman."

"Superman?"

"Uh...fiction. From my homeworld. A human who could fly without wings, and who
was impossibly strong and utterly impervious to all attempts to harm him. And he
used his power to save the world and protect the weak...Well, except he wasn't
really a human, he was an alien who looked exactly like a human whose parents
sent him to Earth because their own planet was about to be destroyed..." he
paused. "Complicated."

"Every species has fiction." I pointed out. "Your Superman sounds like
T'vnndrkktktk, who defended his tribe from a pack of predators for a year
without sleeping."

"Or Gudruvgnagnut, who grew so large that his tribe could shelter beneath him
from the year-storm." said Vedreg. "Though I find it interesting that your
greatest hero was not even of your own species."

"We've always thought of ourselves as weak." Jenkins said. I couldn't restrain
my strangled bleat of disbelief. "Well, by the standards of a lot of species on
Earth, we ARE weak. '*Horses*' can carry more, '*Dogs*' can bite harder and
scent better, most prey species worth hunting could crush an incautious hunter
if they turned to fight, and any of the apex predators will happily eat human.
Our closest evolutionary cousins are much stronger than us. We just happen to be
the ones who figured out brain power, tool use and teamwork to overcome those
challenges." He scratched his tattoo. "And we have other weakness..."

"What is that?" Vedreg asked. I couldn't tell if he had failed to notice the
human's discomfort, or if he simply didn't care.

"Something I've never seen since I first started wandering around all these
stations" Jenkins said. "Tell me...did either of your species ever have
something called "*Religion*"?"

We gave it a moment's thought. "My implant can't find an equivalent concept."
Vedreg told him. I gestured that this was true for me also. "what is it?"

"Our greatest weakness." Jenkins said. "And the reason you guys are going to
shit yourselves when humans finally get off the ground"

We listened, and I privately felt a sense of alarm mounting within me. The
concept was very, VERY alien. Humans, it seemed, had for most of their sentient
era preferred to invent explanations for the world around them rather than admit
a lack of knowledge. They had invented a sentience that was capable of doing any
logically consistent thing, capable of knowing anything. Rather than answer the
mystery of where they had come from, they had historically preferred to tell
stories and then convince themselves that the stories were true. If Jenkins was
to be believed, then the line between fantasy and reality was, for many humans,
invisible.

He told us of the myth he had grown up being told was real. How this great
power--- "God"---had made the universe in a handful of diurnals, and crafted the
first humans from the dirt of their homeworld. They had disobeyed him, and been
punished. As had their descendants, and THEIR descendants, until apparently one
tribe had tortured this being's physical avatar to death---he gestured to the
tattoo at this point, explaining that it depicted a crucifix, the very
instrument of torture in question. This act somehow convinced this "God" thing
to forgive them and be nice to humanity so long as they devoted considerable
time and effort to telling it how great it was.

Vedreg had turned a grim shade of worried dark green by the time Jenkins
finished telling the story. "So...this "God" created humans, got angry at them,
condemned them to be tortured forever and ever after death, and then had itself
sacrificed to itself to save mankind from the very torture it was inflicting
upon them?" he asked. "

Yes" My social implant tentatively suggested that Jenkins' body language
communicated tired endurance.

"And humans believe that this is the real way in which the history of your
species unfolded?"

"About a third of us still do, yes."

We were silent for some time. Vedreg slowly went bluer and bluer until suddenly
he erupted. "WHY?!" he demanded.  

"I don't know." Jenkins responded, calmly.

"You *don't know?* You're wearing the symbol of this...this masochism on your
arm and you *don't know* why your people believe it?"

"I know why I believed it." Jenkins said. "I didn't know any better."

"But...!"

Jenkins interrupted, his implant radiating waning patience and mounting
embarrassment. "I was taught this thing from a very young age as if it was true.
I had no reason to believe I was being lied to, so I accepted it. It took me
half my life to realise that the people who taught me this thing didn't have to
be lying, they could just be wrong."

He swallowed the last of his glass of water. "When I told my family that I had
stopped believing that the God myth was true, they accused me of being evil and
severed all contact with me. I had to go to civilian law enforcement before most
of my property was returned. I was actually driving back from talking with my
lawyer about fighting for the right to have contact with my own offspring when I
was abducted."

He looked me in the eye. "You have to understand...I come from one of the MORE
civilized parts of my planet."

Vedreg and I sat in silence for several minutes, absorbing this news. Jenkins,
if anything, seemed grateful for the silence. "That is...deeply troubling
information, Purveyor Jenkins." Vedreg said, eventually. "It implies that your
entire species is insane."

"I don't disagree." Jenkins replied.  

"And you're strong, fast, impervious to pulse fire---"  

"Not impervious, just highly resilient." I corrected. Vedreg ignored the
correction and forged ahead.

"Have a gland that generates combat drugs...."

I looked at Jenkins, surprised. He did that shrug thing again, this time
wobbling his head apologetically. Vedreg kept going, apparently oblivious to the
exchange.

"And now you tell me that your species is gripped by the fervent belief that a
tale of breathtaking violence and cruelty is all true, and that many of you are
willing to die in service to the principal *villain* of this story? I'm going to
have a hard time convincing anybody that your people should be declared sentient
so long as this state of affairs continues."

"Let me tell you why you need to try." Jenkins said, quietly.

"Why?"

The human gave a worried smile. "Because if you don't, you won't be ready for
us." He said.
